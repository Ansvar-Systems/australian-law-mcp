(5) If, immediately before 1 July 1997, the boundary of a telecommunications network used to supply a standard telephone service to an end - user in a building by means of a line that enters the building is the side of a main distribution frame, or a telephone socket, nearest to the end - user, paragraph (4)(a) has effect, on and after 1 July 1997, as if the customer and the carrier or carriage service provider who operates the network had agreed to the boundary at that point. (6) Subsection (5) does not prevent the customer and the carrier or carriage service provider agreeing to a boundary at a different point. (7) For the purposes of subsection (4), the building entry point is the point at which a line that is used to provide a carriage service to an end - user in a building meets the outer surface of that building, immediately before entering the building.

(4) The ACMA must not make a request under subsection (1) in relation to a code if: (a) the code would deal with a matter referred to in paragraph 113(3)(f) (which relates to privacy); and (b) compliance with the code would be likely to have the effect (whether direct or indirect) of requiring customer equipment, customer cabling, a telecommunications network or a facility: (i) to have particular design features; or (ii) to meet particular performance requirements. However, this rule does not apply if the ACMA is satisfied that the benefits to the community from the operation of the code would outweigh the costs of compliance with the code. (4AA) The rule in subsection (4) does not apply to a code to the extent (if any) to which compliance with the code is likely to have the effect (whether direct or indirect) of requiring: (a) optical fibre lines; or (b) facilities used, or for use, in or in connection with optical fibre lines; to: (c) have particular design features; or (d) meet particular performance requirements. (4A) The ACMA must consult the Information Commissioner before making a request under subsection (1) for the development of an industry code that could reasonably be expected to deal directly or indirectly with a matter dealt with by: (a) the Australian Privacy Principles; or (b) other provisions of the Privacy Act 1988 relating to those principles; or (c) a registered APP code (as defined in that Act) that binds one or more participants in the section of the telecommunications industry, the telemarketing industry or the fax marketing industry to which the request relates; or (d) provisions of that Act that relate to the registered APP code. (5) The ACMA may vary a notice under subsection (1) by extending the period specified in the notice. (6) Subsection (5) does not, by implication, limit the application of subsection 33(3) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 . (7) A notice under subsection (1) may specify indicative targets for achieving progress in the development of the code (for example, a target of 60 days to develop a preliminary draft of the code)."

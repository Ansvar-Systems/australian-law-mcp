(1A) However, paragraph (1)(a) does not apply to the collection by a body corporate of personal information (other than sensitive information) from: (a) a related body corporate that is not an organisation; or (b) a related body corporate whose disclosure of the information to the body corporate is an exempt act or exempt practice for the purposes of paragraph 7(1)(ee); or (c) a related body corporate whose disclosure of the information to the body corporate is not an interference with privacy because of section 13D. Note: The effect of subsection (1A) is that a body corporate’s failure to comply with the Australian Privacy Principles, or a registered APP code that binds the body, in collecting personal information about an individual from a related body corporate covered by that subsection is an interference with the privacy of the individual.

      "content": "Civil penalty provision (1) An entity contravenes this subsection if: (a) the entity does an act, or engages in a practice, that is an interference with the privacy of an individual; and (b) the interference with privacy is serious. Note: The court may determine that an entity has contravened section 13H if the court is satisfied of paragraph (a) but not paragraph (b) (see section 13J). (1A) Subsection (1) is a civil penalty provision. Note: Section 80U deals with civil penalty provisions in this Act. Factors that may be taken into account in determining if interference with privacy is serious (1B) In determining whether an interference with privacy is serious, a court may have regard to any of the following matters: (a) the particular kind or kinds of information involved in the interference with privacy; (b) the sensitivity of the personal information of the individual; (c) the consequences, or potential consequences, of the interference with privacy for the individual; (d) the number of individuals affected by the interference with privacy; (e) whether the individual affected by the interference with privacy is a child or person experiencing vulnerability; (f) whether the act was done, or the practice engaged in, repeatedly or continuously; (g) whether the contravening entity failed to take steps to implement practices, procedures and systems to comply with their obligations in relation to privacy in a way that contributed to the interference with privacy; (h) any other relevant matter. Maximum pecuniary penalty (2) The amount of the penalty for a contravention of subsection (1) by a person other than a body corporate is an amount not more than $2,500,000. (3) The amount of the penalty for a contravention of subsection (1) by a body corporate is an amount not more than the greatest of the following: (a) $50,000,000; (b) if the court can determine the value of the benefit that the body corporate, and any related body corporate, have obtained directly or indirectly and that is reasonably attributable to the conduct constituting the contravention—3 times the value of that benefit; (c) if the court cannot determine the value of that benefit—30% of the adjusted turnover of the body corporate during the breach turnover period for the contravention. (4) Subsection (3) applies despite paragraph 82(5)(a) of the Regulatory Powers Act. Meaning of adjusted turnover (5) For the purposes of paragraph (3)(c), the adjusted turnover of a body corporate during a period is the sum of the values of all the supplies that the body corporate, and any related body corporate, have made, or are likely to make, during the period, other than: (a) supplies made from any of those bodies corporate to any other of those bodies corporate; or (b) supplies that are input taxed; or (c) supplies that are not for consideration (and are not taxable supplies under section 72 - 5 of the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 ); or (d) supplies that are not made in connection with an enterprise that the body corporate carries on; or (e) supplies that are not connected with the indirect tax zone. (6) Expressions used in subsection (5) that are also used in the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 have the same meaning as in that Act. Meaning of breach turnover period (7) For the purposes of paragraph (3)(c), the breach turnover period for a contravention means the longer of the following periods: (a) the period of 12 months ending at the end of the month in which the contravention ceased, or proceedings in relation to the contravention were instituted (whichever is earlier); (b) the period: (i) starting at the beginning of the month in which the contravention occurred or began occurring; and (ii) ending at the same time as the period determined under paragraph (a)."

Exception to access—organisation 12.3 If the APP entity is an organisation then, despite subclause 12.1, the entity is not required to give the individual access to the personal information to the extent that: (a) the entity reasonably believes that giving access would pose a serious threat to the life, health or safety of any individual, or to public health or public safety; or (b) giving access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other individuals; or (c) the request for access is frivolous or vexatious; or (d) the information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between the entity and the individual, and would not be accessible by the process of discovery in those proceedings; or (e) giving access would reveal the intentions of the entity in relation to negotiations with the individual in such a way as to prejudice those negotiations; or (f) giving access would be unlawful; or (g) denying access is required or authorised by or under an Australian law or a court/tribunal order; or (h) both of the following apply: (i) the entity has reason to suspect that unlawful activity, or misconduct of a serious nature, that relates to the entity’s functions or activities has been, is being or may be engaged in; (ii) giving access would be likely to prejudice the taking of appropriate action in relation to the matter; or (i) giving access would be likely to prejudice one or more enforcement related activities conducted by, or on behalf of, an enforcement body; or (j) giving access would reveal evaluative information generated within the entity in connection with a commercially sensitive decision - making process. Dealing with requests for access 12.4 The APP entity must: (a) respond to the request for access to the personal information: (i) if the entity is an agency—within 30 days after the request is made; or (ii) if the entity is an organisation—within a reasonable period after the request is made; and (b) give access to the information in the manner requested by the individual, if it is reasonable and practicable to do so. Other means of access 12.5 If the APP entity refuses: (a) to give access to the personal information because of subclause 12.2 or 12.3; or (b) to give access in the manner requested by the individual; the entity must take such steps (if any) as are reasonable in the circumstances to give access in a way that meets the needs of the entity and the individual. 12.6 Without limiting subclause 12.5, access may be given through the use of a mutually agreed intermediary. Access charges 12.7 If the APP entity is an agency, the entity must not charge the individual for the making of the request or for giving access to the personal information. 12.8 If: (a) the APP entity is an organisation; and (b) the entity charges the individual for giving access to the personal information; the charge must not be excessive and must not apply to the making of the request. Refusal to give access 12.9 If the APP entity refuses to give access to the personal information because of subclause 12.2 or 12.3, or to give access in the manner requested by the individual, the entity must give the individual a written notice that sets out: (a) the reasons for the refusal except to the extent that, having regard to the grounds for the refusal, it would be unreasonable to do so; and (b) the mechanisms available to complain about the refusal; and (c) any other matter prescribed by the regulations. 12.10 If the APP entity refuses to give access to the personal information because of paragraph 12.3(j), the reasons for the refusal may include an explanation for the commercially sensitive decision."

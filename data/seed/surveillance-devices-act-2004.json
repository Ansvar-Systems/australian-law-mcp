(2) In determining whether a data disruption warrant should be issued, the eligible Judge or nominated ART member must have regard to: (a) the nature and gravity of the conduct constituting the offences referred to in paragraph 27KA(1)(c); and (b) the likelihood that the disruption of data authorised by the warrant will frustrate the commission of the offences referred to in paragraph 27KA(1)(c); and (c) the existence of any alternative means of frustrating the commission of the offences referred to in paragraph 27KA(1)(c); and (ca) the nature of the things proposed to be authorised by the warrant in accordance with section 27KE; and (cb) the extent to which the execution of the warrant is likely to result in access to, or disruption of, data of persons lawfully using a computer, and any privacy implications (to the extent known) resulting from that access or disruption; and (cc) any steps that are proposed to be taken to avoid or minimise the extent to which the execution of the warrant is likely to impact on persons lawfully using a computer; and (cd) the extent to which the execution of the warrant is likely to cause a person to suffer a temporary loss of: (i) money; or (ii) digital currency; or (iii) property (other than data); so far as that matter is known to the eligible Judge or nominated ART member; and (ce) if: (i) the eligible Judge or nominated ART member believes on reasonable grounds that the data covered by the warrant (within the meaning of section 27KE) is data of a person who is working in a professional capacity as a journalist or of an employer of such a person; and (ii) each of the offences referred to in paragraph 27KA(1)(c) is an offence against a secrecy provision; whether the public interest in issuing the warrant outweighs: (iii) the public interest in protecting the confidentiality of the identity of the journalist’s source; and (iv) the public interest in facilitating the exchange of information between journalists and members of the public so as to facilitate reporting of matters in the public interest; and (d) any previous warrant sought or issued under this Division in relation to the alleged relevant offences referred to in paragraph 27KA(1)(c). (3) For the purposes of having regard to the nature and gravity of the conduct constituting the offences referred to in paragraph 27KA(1)(c), the eligible Judge or a nominated ART member must give weight to the following matters: (a) whether that conduct amounts to: (i) an activity against the security of the Commonwealth; or (ii) an offence against Chapter 5 of the Criminal Code ; (b) whether that conduct amounts to: (i) an activity against the proper administration of Government; or (ii) an offence against Chapter 7 of the Criminal Code ; (c) whether that conduct: (i) causes, or has the potential to cause, serious violence, or serious harm, to a person; or (ii) amounts to an offence against Chapter 8 of the Criminal Code ; (d) whether that conduct: (i) causes, or has the potential to cause, a danger to the community; or (ii) amounts to an offence against Chapter 9 of the Criminal Code ; (e) whether that conduct: (i) causes, or has the potential to cause, substantial damage to, or loss of, data, property or critical infrastructure; or (ii) amounts to an offence against Chapter 10 of the Criminal Code ; (f) whether that conduct involves, or is related to, the commission of: (i) transnational crime; or (ii) serious crime; or (iii) organised crime; that is not covered by any of the preceding paragraphs. (4) Subsection (3) does not limit the matters that may be considered by the eligible Judge or nominated ART member. (5) To avoid doubt, this Act does not prevent a data disruption warrant from being issued in a case where the conduct constituting the offences referred to in paragraph 27KA(1)(c) is not covered by subsection (3). (6) For the purposes of this section, secrecy provision means a provision of a law of the Commonwealth or of a State that prohibits: (a) the communication, divulging or publication of information; or (b) the production of, or the publication of the contents of, a document."

      "content": "(1) An eligible Judge or a nominated ART member may issue a network activity warrant if satisfied: (a) that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion founding the application for the warrant; and (aa) that the issue of the warrant is justified and proportionate, having regard to the kinds of offences in relation to which information will be obtained under the warrant; and (b) in the case of an unsworn application—that it would have been impracticable for an affidavit to have been sworn or prepared before the application was made; and (c) in the case of a remote application—that it would have been impracticable for the application to have been made in person. (2) In determining whether a network activity warrant should be issued, the eligible Judge or nominated ART member must have regard to: (a) the nature and gravity of the conduct constituting the kinds of offences in relation to which information will be obtained under the warrant; and (b) the extent to which access to data under the warrant will assist in the collection of intelligence that: (i) relates to the group referred to in paragraph 27KK(1)(a) or to any of the individuals in the group; and (ii) is relevant to the prevention, detection or frustration of one or more kinds of relevant offences; and (c) the likely intelligence value of any information sought to be obtained; and (d) whether the things authorised by the warrant are proportionate to the likely intelligence value of any information sought to be obtained; and (e) the existence of any alternative, or less intrusive, means of obtaining the information sought to be obtained; and (f) the extent to which the execution of the warrant is likely to result in access to data of persons who are lawfully using a computer, and any privacy implications (to the extent known to the eligible Judge or nominated ART member) resulting from that access; and (fa) if: (i) the eligible Judge or nominated ART member believes on reasonable grounds that the data covered by the warrant (within the meaning of section 27KP) is data of a person who is working in a professional capacity as a journalist or of an employer of such a person; and (ii) each of the offences referred to in paragraph 27KK(1)(b) is an offence against a secrecy provision; whether the public interest in issuing the warrant outweighs: (iii) the public interest in protecting the confidentiality of the identity of the journalist’s source; and (iv) the public interest in facilitating the exchange of information between journalists and members of the public so as to facilitate reporting of matters in the public interest; and (g) any previous warrant sought or issued under this Division in relation to the group referred to in paragraph 27KK(1)(a). (2A) For the purposes of having regard to the nature and gravity of the conduct constituting the kinds of offences in relation to which information will be obtained under the warrant, the eligible Judge or nominated ART member must give weight to the following matters: (a) whether that conduct amounts to: (i) an activity against the security of the Commonwealth; or (ii) an offence against Chapter 5 of the Criminal Code ; (b) whether that conduct amounts to: (i) an activity against the proper administration of Government; or (ii) an offence against Chapter 7 of the Criminal Code ; (c) whether that conduct: (i) causes, or has the potential to cause, serious violence, or serious harm, to a person; or (ii) amounts to an offence against Chapter 8 of the Criminal Code ; (d) whether that conduct: (i) causes, or has the potential to cause, a danger to the community; or (ii) amounts to an offence against Chapter 9 of the Criminal Code ; (e) whether that conduct: (i) causes, or has the potential to cause, substantial damage to, or loss of, data, property or critical infrastructure; or (ii) amounts to an offence against Chapter 10 of the Criminal Code ; (f) whether that conduct involves, or is related to, the commission of: (i) transnational crime; or (ii) serious crime; or (iii) organised crime; that is not covered by any of the preceding paragraphs. (2B) Subsection (2A) does not limit the matters that may be considered by the eligible Judge or nominated ART member. (2C) To avoid doubt, this Act does not prevent a network activity warrant from being issued in a case where the conduct constituting the kinds of offences in relation to which information will be obtained under the warrant is not covered by subsection (2A). (3) If a network activity warrant is issued in response to an application made by the chief officer of the Australian Federal Police or the Australian Crime Commission, the chief officer must: (a) notify the issue of the warrant to the Inspector - General of Intelligence and Security; and (b) do so within 7 days after the issue of the warrant. (4) For the purposes of this section, secrecy provision means a provision of a law of the Commonwealth or of a State that prohibits: (a) the communication, divulging or publication of information; or (b) the production of, or the publication of the contents of, a document."

(3A) A federal law enforcement officer may, with the written permission of an appropriate authorising officer, use a tracking device without a warrant for the purposes of an integrity operation. (3B) If a Part 5.3 supervisory order is in force in relation to a person, a law enforcement officer may, with the written permission of an appropriate authorising officer, use a tracking device without a warrant to obtain information relating to the person for either of the following purposes: (a) achieving a Part 5.3 object; (b) determining whether the Part 5.3 supervisory order, or any succeeding Part 5.3 supervisory order, has been, or is being, complied with. (3C) If a community safety supervision order is in force in relation to a person, a law enforcement officer may, with the written permission of an appropriate authorising officer, use a tracking device without a warrant to obtain information relating to the person for either of the following purposes: (a) achieving a Part 9.10 object; (b) determining whether the community safety supervision order, or any succeeding community safety supervision order, has been, or is being, complied with. (4) Subsections (1), (3), (3A), (3B) and (3C) have effect despite any other law of the Commonwealth or of a State or self - governing Territory (including any principle of the common law) forbidding the use of such a device without a warrant. (5) A tracking device authorisation given under subsection (1), (3), (3A), (3B) or (3C) may authorise the law enforcement officer to use more than one tracking device. (6) If an appropriate authorising officer gives a tracking device authorisation under this section, an appropriate authorising officer may also authorise the retrieval, without a warrant, of a tracking device to which the tracking device authorisation relates. (7) A tracking device authorisation given under subsection (1), (3), (3A), (3B) or (3C) and an authorisation for the retrieval of a tracking device given under subsection (6) must indicate the period, not exceeding 90 days, for which the authorisation remains in force. (8) An appropriate authorising officer must not give permission under this section for the use, installation or retrieval of a tracking device if the installation of the device, or its retrieval, involves entry onto premises without permission or an interference with the interior of a vehicle without permission. Note: Section 22 deals with applications for a retrieval warrant in respect of a tracking device that was lawfully installed under a tracking device authorisation. (9) For the purposes of obtaining the permission of an appropriate authorising officer, the law enforcement officer wishing to use that device: (a) must apply, orally or in writing, to the appropriate authorising officer; and (b) must address, in that application, the matters that would be required to be addressed if the law enforcement officer were making an application for a surveillance device warrant or a retrieval warrant, as the case requires.

(11) Paragraphs 26(1)(a), (c), (d) and (e) and subsections 26(2) and (3) apply in relation to a tracking device authorisation authorising the retrieval of a tracking device as if: (a) references in those provisions to a retrieval warrant were references to a tracking device authorisation authorising the retrieval of a tracking device; and (b) references in those provisions to a surveillance device were references to a tracking device. (12) A law enforcement officer may use a tracking device authorisation only if he or she is acting in the performance of his or her duty."

(5) Despite subsections (1), (2) and (3), if: (a) a vessel that is registered under the law of a foreign country is in waters beyond the outer limits of the territorial sea of Australia but not beyond the outer limits of the Australian fishing zone; and (b) the relevant offence in respect of which it becomes apparent that surveillance on the vessel will be required is an offence against section 100, 100A, 100B, 101, 101A or 101AA of the Fisheries Management Act 1991 or section 46A, 46B, 46C, 46D, 49A or 51A of the Torres Strait Fisheries Act 1984 ; there is no requirement for the agreement of an appropriate consenting official of the foreign country concerned in relation to that surveillance while the vessel is in those waters. (6) As soon as practicable after the commencement of surveillance under the authority of a surveillance device warrant: (a) in a foreign country; or (b) in circumstances where consent to that surveillance is required—on a vessel or aircraft that is registered under the law of a foreign country; the chief officer of the law enforcement agency to which the law enforcement officer who applied for the warrant belongs or is seconded must give the Minister evidence in writing that the surveillance has been agreed to by an appropriate consenting official of the foreign country. (7) An instrument providing evidence of the kind referred to in subsection (6) is not a legislative instrument. (8) If a vessel or aircraft that is registered under the laws of a foreign country is in or above the territorial sea of another foreign country, subsections (1), (2) and (3) have effect as if the reference to an appropriate consenting official of the foreign country were a reference to an appropriate consenting official of each foreign country concerned. (9) For the avoidance of doubt, there is no requirement for the agreement of an appropriate consenting official of the foreign country to the surveillance under the authority of a surveillance device warrant of a vessel or aircraft of a foreign country that is in Australia or in or above waters within the outer limits of the territorial sea of Australia."

(7) As soon as practicable after the commencement of access to data held in a computer under the authority of a computer access warrant in circumstances where consent to that access is required: (a) in a foreign country; or (b) on a vessel or aircraft that is registered under the law of a foreign country; the chief officer of the law enforcement agency to which the law enforcement officer who applied for the warrant belongs or is seconded must give the Minister evidence in writing that the access has been agreed to by an appropriate consenting official of the foreign country. (8) An instrument providing evidence of the kind referred to in subsection (7) is not a legislative instrument.

(10) For the avoidance of doubt, there is no requirement for the agreement of an appropriate consenting official of the foreign country to the access to data held in a computer under the authority of a computer access warrant on a vessel or aircraft of a foreign country that is in Australia or in or above waters within the outer limits of the territorial sea of Australia."

State or Territory legislative power sufficient to support duty (2) The duty is taken not to be imposed by this Part (or any other law of the Commonwealth) to the extent to which: (a) imposing the duty is within the legislative powers of the State or Territory concerned; and (b) imposing the duty by the law or instrument of the State or Territory is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the AER. Note: If this subsection applies, the duty will be taken to be imposed by force of the law or instrument of the State or Territory (the Commonwealth having consented under section 44AI to the imposition of the duty by that law or instrument). Commonwealth legislative power sufficient to support duty but State or Territory legislative powers are not (3) If, to ensure the validity of the purported imposition of the duty, it is necessary that the duty be imposed by a law of the Commonwealth (rather than by the law or instrument of the State or Territory), the duty is taken to be imposed by this Part to the extent necessary to ensure that validity. (4) If, because of subsection (3), this Part is taken to impose the duty, it is the intention of the Parliament to rely on all powers available to it under the Constitution to support the imposition of the duty by this Part. (5) The duty is taken to be imposed by this Part in accordance with subsection (3) only to the extent to which imposing the duty: (a) is within the legislative powers of the Commonwealth; and (b) is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the AER.

Note 1: There are time limits that apply to the Council’s recommendation: see section 44GA. Note 2: The Council may request information and invite public submissions on the application: see sections 44FA and 44GB. Note 3: The Council must publish its recommendation: see section 44GC.

(6) The applicant may request, in writing, the Council to vary the application at any time before the Council makes a recommendation relating to it. (7) If a request is made under subsection (6), the Council must decide to: (a) make the variation; or (b) reject the variation. (9) The Council may reject the variation if it is satisfied that the requested variation is of a kind, or the request for the variation is made at a time or in a manner, that: (a) would unduly prejudice the provider (if the provider is not the applicant) or anyone else the Council considers has a material interest in the application; or (b) would unduly delay the process for considering the application."

Note: Without infringing paragraph (1)(b), a determination may deprive a second person of the right to be supplied with an amount of service equal to the difference between the total amount of service the person was entitled to under a pre - notification right and the amount that the person actually needs to meet his or her actual requirements. (4A) If an application for review of a declaration of a service has been made under subsection 44K(1), the Commission must not make a determination in relation to the service until the Tribunal has made its decision on the review. (5) In this section: existing user means a person (including the provider) who was using the service at the time when the dispute was notified. pre - notification right means a right under a contract, or under a determination, that was in force at the time when the dispute was notified. protected contractual right means a right under a contract that was in force at the beginning of 30 March 1995."

(5) The duty is taken to be imposed by this Act in accordance with subsection (3) only to the extent to which imposing the duty: (a) is within the legislative powers of the Commonwealth; and (b) is consistent with the constitutional doctrines restricting the duties that may be imposed on the Commission or Tribunal.

      "content": "(1) A corporation must not: (a) make a contract or arrangement, or arrive at an understanding, if a provision of the proposed contract, arrangement or understanding has the purpose, or would have or be likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition; or (b) give effect to a provision of a contract, arrangement or understanding, if that provision has the purpose, or has or is likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition; or (c) engage with one or more persons in a concerted practice that has the purpose, or has or is likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition. (2) Paragraph (1)(b) applies in relation to contracts or arrangements made, or understandings arrived at, before or after the commencement of this section. (3) For the purposes of this section, competition means: (a) in relation to a provision of a contract, arrangement or understanding or of a proposed contract, arrangement or understanding—competition in any market in which: (i) a corporation that is a party to the contract, arrangement or understanding, or would be a party to the proposed contract, arrangement or understanding; or (ii) any body corporate related to such a corporation; supplies or acquires, or is likely to supply or acquire, goods or services or would, but for the provision, supply or acquire, or be likely to supply or acquire, goods or services; or (b) in relation to a concerted practice—competition in any market in which: (i) a corporation that is a party to the practice; or (ii) any body corporate related to such a corporation; supplies or acquires, or is likely to supply or acquire, goods or services or would, but for the practice, supply or acquire, or be likely to supply or acquire, goods or services. (4) For the purposes of the application of this section in relation to a particular corporation, a provision of a contract, arrangement or understanding or of a proposed contract, arrangement or understanding shall be deemed to have or to be likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition if that provision and any one or more of the following provisions, namely: (a) the other provisions of that contract, arrangement or understanding or proposed contract, arrangement or understanding; and (b) the provisions of any other contract, arrangement or understanding or proposed contract, arrangement or understanding to which the corporation or a body corporate related to the corporation is or would be a party; together have or are likely to have that effect. (5) This section does not apply to or in relation to a provision of a contract, arrangement or understanding or of a proposed contract, arrangement or understanding, or to or in relation to a concerted practice, in so far as the provision or practice relates to: (a) conduct that contravenes section 48; or (b) conduct that would contravene section 48 if subsection 48(2) did not apply; or (c) conduct that would contravene section 48 if it were not authorised under section 88; or (d) conduct that would contravene section 48 if this Act defined the acts constituting the practice of resale price maintenance by reference to the maximum price at which goods or services are to be sold or supplied or are to be advertised, displayed or offered for sale or supply. (5A) The making of a contract, arrangement or understanding does not constitute a contravention of this section because the contract, arrangement or understanding contains a provision the giving effect to which would, or would apart from subsection 47(10) or section 88 or 93, constitute a contravention of section 47. (6) This section does not apply to or in relation to the giving effect to a provision of a contract, arrangement or understanding, or to or in relation to engaging in a concerted practice, by way of: (a) engaging in conduct that contravenes, or would but for the operation of subsection 47(10) or section 88 or 93 contravene, section 47; or (b) doing an act by reason of a breach or threatened breach of a condition referred to in subsection 47(2), (4), (6) or (8), being an act done by a person at a time when: (i) an authorisation under section 88 is in force in relation to conduct engaged in by that person on that condition; or (ii) by reason of subsection 93(7) conduct engaged in by that person on that condition is not to be taken to have the effect of substantially lessening competition within the meaning of section 47; or (iii) a notice under subsection 93(1) is in force in relation to conduct engaged in by that person on that condition. (6A) The following conduct: (a) the making of a dual listed company arrangement; (b) the giving effect to a provision of a dual listed company arrangement; does not contravene this section if the conduct would, or would apart from section 88, contravene section 49. (7) This section does not apply to or in relation to: (a) a contract, arrangement or understanding to the extent that the contract, arrangement or understanding directly or indirectly provides for; or (b) a proposed contract, arrangement or understanding to the extent that the proposed contract, arrangement or understanding would directly or indirectly provide for; or (c) a concerted practice to the extent that the practice directly involves; the acquisition of any shares in the capital of a body corporate or any assets of a person or a notified acquisition. (8) This section does not apply to or in relation to: (a) a contract, arrangement or understanding, or (b) a proposed contract, arrangement or understanding; or (c) a concerted practice; the only parties to which are or would be bodies corporate that are related to each other. (8AA) This section does not apply to or in relation to a concerted practice if the only persons engaging in it are or would be: (a) the Crown in right of the Commonwealth and one or more authorities of the Commonwealth; or (b) the Crown in right of a State or Territory and one or more authorities of that State or Territory. (8A) Subsection (1) does not apply to a corporation engaging in conduct described in that subsection if: (a) the corporation has given the Commission a collective bargaining notice under subsection 93AB(1) describing the conduct; and (b) the notice is in force under section 93AD. (8B) The making by a corporation of a contract is not a contravention of subsection (1) to the extent that the contract provides for an acquisition, if the contract is subject to a condition that the provision of the contract will not come into force unless and until the acquisition becomes a notified acquisition. (8C) Nothing in subsection (8B) prevents the giving effect by a corporation to such a provision of a contract from constituting a contravention of subsection (1). (9) The making by a corporation of a contract that contains a provision in relation to which the corporation intends to apply for an authorisation under section 88 is not a contravention of subsection (1) of this section if: (a) the contract is subject to a condition that the provision will not come into force unless and until the corporation is granted an authorisation to give effect to the provision; and (b) the corporation applies for the grant of such an authorisation within 14 days after the contract is made; but nothing in this subsection prevents the giving effect by a corporation to such a provision from constituting a contravention of subsection (1)."

Dominant purpose of conduct relates to employment matters—conduct by employee organisation and employees (2) If: (a) an employee, or 2 or more employees who are employed by the same employer, engage in conduct in concert with another person who is, or with other persons each of whom is: (i) an organisation of employees; or (ii) an officer of an organisation of employees; and (b) the conduct is only engaged in by the persons covered by paragraph (a); and (c) the dominant purpose for which the conduct is engaged in is substantially related to the remuneration, conditions of employment, hours of work or working conditions of the employee, or any of the employees, covered by paragraph (a); the persons covered by paragraph (a) do not contravene, and are not involved in a contravention of, subsection 45D(1), 45DA(1) or 45DB(1) by engaging in the conduct. Dominant purpose of conduct relates to environmental protection or consumer protection (3) A person does not contravene, and is not involved in a contravention of, subsection 45D(1), 45DA(1) or 45DB(1) by engaging in conduct if: (a) the dominant purpose for which the conduct is engaged in is substantially related to environmental protection or consumer protection; and (b) engaging in the conduct is not industrial action. Note 1: If an environmental organisation or a consumer organisation is a body corporate: (a) it is a “person” who may be subject to the prohibitions in subsections 45D(1), 45DA(1) and 45DB(1) and who may also be covered by this exemption; and (b) each of its members is a “person” who may be subject to the prohibitions in subsections 45D(1), 45DA(1) and 45DB(1) and who may also be covered by this exemption. Note 2: If an environmental organisation or a consumer organisation is not a body corporate: (a) it is not a “person” and is therefore not subject to the prohibitions in subsections 45D(1), 45DA(1) and 45DB(1) (consequently, this exemption does not cover the organisation as such); but (b) each of its members is a “person” who may be subject to the prohibitions in subsections 45D(1), 45DA(1) and 45DB(1) and who may also be covered by this exemption. Meaning of industrial action —basic definition (4) In subsection (3), industrial action means: (a) the performance of work in a manner different from that in which it is customarily performed, or the adoption of a practice in relation to work, the result of which is a restriction or limitation on, or a delay in, the performance of the work, where: (i) the terms and conditions of the work are prescribed, wholly or partly, by a workplace instrument or an order of an industrial body; or (ii) the work is performed, or the practice is adopted, in connection with an industrial dispute; or (b) a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of work, or on acceptance of or offering for work, in accordance with the terms and conditions prescribed by a workplace instrument or by an order of an industrial body; or (c) a ban, limitation or restriction on the performance of work, or on acceptance of or offering for work, that is adopted in connection with an industrial dispute; or (d) a failure or refusal by persons to attend for work or a failure or refusal to perform any work at all by persons who attend for work. For this purpose, industrial body and workplace instrument have the same meanings as in the Fair Work Act 2009 . Meaning of industrial action —further clarification (5) For the purposes of subsection (3): (a) conduct is capable of constituting industrial action even if the conduct relates to part only of the duties that persons are required to perform in the course of their employment; and (b) a reference to industrial action includes a reference to a course of conduct consisting of a series of industrial actions. Subsections (1), (2) and (3) do not protect people not covered by them (6) In applying subsection 45D(1), 45DA(1) or 45DB(1) to a person who is not covered by subsection (1), (2) or (3) in respect of certain conduct, disregard the fact that other persons may be covered by one of those subsections in respect of the same conduct. Defences to contravention of subsection 45DB(1) (7) In a proceeding under this Act in relation to a contravention of subsection 45DB(1), it is a defence if the defendant proves: (a) that a notice in respect of the conduct concerned has been duly given to the Commission under subsection 93(1) and the Commission has not given a notice in respect of the conduct under subsection 93(3) or (3A); or (b) that the dominant purpose for which the defendant engaged in the conduct concerned was to preserve or further a business carried on by him or her. Each person to prove defence (8) If: (a) a person engages in conduct in concert with another person; and (b) the other person proves a matter specified in paragraph (7)(a) or (b) in respect of that conduct; in applying subsection 45DB(1) to the first person, ignore the fact that the other person has proved that matter. Note: Section 415 of the Fair Work Act 2009 limits the right to bring actions under this Act in respect of industrial action that is protected action for the purposes of that section."

Prohibition in a supply situation (2) In a supply situation, the first person must not make a contract or arrangement, or arrive at an understanding, with an organisation of employees, an officer of such an organisation or a person acting for and on behalf of such an officer or organisation, if the proposed contract, arrangement or understanding contains a provision included for the purpose, or for purposes including the purpose, of: (a) preventing or hindering the first person from supplying or continuing to supply such goods or services to the second person; or (b) preventing or hindering the first person from supplying or continuing to supply such goods or services to the second person, except subject to a condition: (i) that is not a condition to which the supply of such goods or services by the first person to the second person has previously been subject because of a provision in a contract between those persons; and (ii) that is about the persons to whom, the manner in which or the terms on which the second person may supply any goods or services. Prohibition in an acquisition situation (3) In an acquisition situation, the first person must not make a contract or arrangement, or arrive at an understanding, with an organisation of employees, an officer of such an organisation or a person acting for and on behalf of such an officer or organisation, if the proposed contract, arrangement or understanding contains a provision included for the purpose, or for purposes including the purpose, of: (a) preventing or hindering the first person from acquiring or continuing to acquire such goods or services from the second person; or (b) preventing or hindering the first person from acquiring or continuing to acquire such goods or services from the second person, except subject to a condition: (i) that is not a condition to which the acquisition of such goods or services by the first person from the second person has previously been subject because of a provision in a contract between those persons; and (ii) that is about the persons to whom, the manner in which or the terms on which the second person may supply any goods or services. No contravention if second person gives written consent to written contract etc. (4) Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply to a contract, arrangement or understanding if it is in writing and was made or arrived at with the written consent of the second person.

(3) A corporation is taken for the purposes of this section to have a substantial degree of power in a market if: (a) a body corporate that is related to that corporation has, or 2 or more bodies corporate each of which is related to that corporation together have, a substantial degree of power in that market; or (b) that corporation and a body corporate that is, or that corporation and 2 or more bodies corporate each of which is, related to that corporation, together have a substantial degree of power in that market. (4) In determining for the purposes of this section the degree of power that a body corporate or bodies corporate have in a market: (a) regard must be had to the extent to which the conduct of the body corporate or of any of those bodies corporate in that market is constrained by the conduct of: (i) competitors, or potential competitors, of the body corporate or of any of those bodies corporate in that market; or (ii) persons to whom or from whom the body corporate or any of those bodies corporate supplies or acquires goods or services in that market; and (b) regard may be had to the power the body corporate or bodies corporate have in that market that results from: (i) any contracts, arrangements or understandings that the body corporate or bodies corporate have with another party or other parties; or (ii) any proposed contracts, arrangements or understandings that the body corporate or bodies corporate may have with another party or other parties. (5) For the purposes of this section, a body corporate may have a substantial degree of power in a market even though: (a) the body corporate does not substantially control that market; or (b) the body corporate does not have absolute freedom from constraint by the conduct of: (i) competitors, or potential competitors, of the body corporate in that market; or (ii) persons to whom or from whom the body corporate supplies or acquires goods or services in that market. (6) Subsections (4) and (5) do not limit the matters to which regard may be had in determining, for the purposes of this section, the degree of power that a body corporate or bodies corporate has or have in a market. (7) To avoid doubt, for the purposes of this section, more than one corporation may have a substantial degree of power in a market. (8) In this section: (a) a reference to power is a reference to market power; and (b) a reference to a market is a reference to a market for goods or services; and (c) a reference to power in relation to, or to conduct in, a market is a reference to power, or to conduct, in that market either as a supplier or as an acquirer of goods or services in that market."

(2) A corporation that has a substantial degree of market power in a trans - Tasman market must not take advantage of that power for the purpose of: (a) eliminating or substantially damaging a competitor of the corporation, or of a body corporate that is related to the corporation, in an impact market; or (b) preventing the entry of a person into an impact market; or (c) deterring or preventing a person from engaging in competitive conduct in an impact market. (2A) For the purposes of subsection (2): (a) the reference in paragraph (2)(a) to a competitor includes a reference to competitors generally, or to a particular class or classes of competitors; and (b) the reference in paragraphs (2)(b) and (c) to a person includes a reference to persons generally, or to a particular class or classes of persons. (3) If: (a) a body corporate that is related to a corporation has, or 2 or more bodies corporate each of which is related to the one corporation together have, a substantial degree of market power in a trans - Tasman market; or (b) a corporation and a body corporate that is, or a corporation and 2 or more bodies corporate each of which is, related to the corporation, together have a substantial degree of market power in a trans - Tasman market; the corporation is taken, for the purposes of this section, to have a substantial degree of market power in the trans - Tasman market. (4) In determining for the purposes of this section the degree of market power that a body corporate or bodies corporate has or have in a trans - Tasman market, the Federal Court is to have regard to the extent to which the conduct of the body corporate or of any of those bodies corporate, in the trans - Tasman market is constrained by the conduct of: (a) competitors, or potential competitors, of the body corporate, or of any of those bodies corporate, in the trans - Tasman market; or (b) persons to whom or from whom the body corporate, or any of those bodies corporate, supplies or acquires goods or services in the trans - Tasman market. (5) Without extending by implication the meaning of subsection (2), a corporation is not taken to contravene that subsection merely because it acquires plant or equipment. (6) This section does not prevent a corporation from engaging in conduct that does not constitute a contravention of any of the following sections, namely, sections 45, 47, 49 and 50, because an authorisation is in force or because of the operation of subsection 45(8A) or section 93. (7) Without limiting the manner in which the purpose of a person may be established for the purposes of any other provision of this Act, a corporation may be taken to have taken advantage of its market power for a purpose referred to in subsection (2) even though, after all the evidence has been considered, the existence of that purpose is ascertainable only by inference from the conduct of the corporation or of any other person or from other relevant circumstances. (8) It is the intention of the Parliament that this section, and the provisions of Parts VI and XII so far as they relate to a contravention of this section, should apply to New Zealand and New Zealand Crown corporations to the same extent, and in the same way, as they respectively apply under section 2A to the Commonwealth and authorities of the Commonwealth. (9) Subsection (8) has effect despite section 9 of the Foreign States Immunities Act 1985 ."

Note: Conduct that would otherwise contravene this section can be authorised under section 88.

(1A) Without limiting the matters that may be taken into account in determining whether the obtaining of the second controlling interest would have the effect, or be likely to have the effect, of substantially lessening competition in a market, the matters mentioned in subsection 50(3) must be taken into account for that purpose. (1B) In determining whether the obtaining of the second controlling interest would result, or be likely to result, in such a benefit to the public that it should be disregarded for the purposes of this section: (a) the Tribunal must regard the following as benefits to the public (in addition to any other benefits to the public that may exist apart from this paragraph): (i) a significant increase in the real value of exports; (ii) a significant substitution of domestic products for imported goods; and (b) without limiting the matters that may be taken into account, the Tribunal must take into account all other relevant matters that relate to the international competitiveness of any Australian industry. (2) Where an application under subsection (1) is made: (a) the Tribunal shall give to: (i) each corporation in relation to which the application relates; and (ii) the Minister and the Commission; a notice in writing stating that the application has been made; and (b) the persons referred to in paragraph (a) and, if the application was made by another person, that other person are entitled to appear, or be represented, at the proceedings following the application. (3) An application under subsection (1) may be made at any time within 12 months after the date of the acquisition referred to in that subsection in relation to which the application is made. (4) The Tribunal may, on the application of the Minister, the Commission or any other person, or of its own motion, revoke a declaration made under subsection (1). (5) The Tribunal shall state in writing its reasons for making, refusing to make or revoking a declaration under subsection (1). (6) After the end of 6 months after a declaration is made under subsection (1) in relation to the obtaining of a controlling interest in a corporation or 2 or more corporations by a person or, if the person, before the end of that period of 6 months, makes an application to a presidential member for an extension of that period, after the end of such further period (not exceeding 6 months) as the presidential member allows, the corporation or each of the corporations, as the case may be, shall not, while the declaration remains in force, carry on business in the market to which the declaration relates. (7) Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to an acquisition referred to in that subsection if section 50 applies in relation to that acquisition. (7A) Subsection (1) does not apply to: (a) a notified acquisition; or (b) an acquisition that is put into effect on or after 1 January 2026. (8) For the purposes of this section: (a) a person shall be taken to hold a controlling interest in a body corporate if the body corporate is, or, if the person were a body corporate, would be, a subsidiary of the person (otherwise than by reason of the application of paragraph 4A(1)(b)); and (b) where a person holds a controlling interest (including a controlling interest held by virtue of another application or other applications of this paragraph) in a body corporate and that body corporate: (i) controls the composition of the board of directors of another body corporate; (ii) is in a position to cast, or control the casting of, any votes that might be cast at a general meeting of another body corporate; or (iii) holds shares in the capital of another body corporate; the person shall be deemed (but not to the exclusion of any other person) to control the composition of that board, to be in a position to cast, or control the casting of, those votes or to hold those shares, as the case may be.

Conferral of functions and powers (1A) If regulations prescribe an industry code, the industry code may confer on a person or body functions and powers in relation to the code, including functions and powers in relation to the following matters: (a) monitoring compliance with the code; (b) dealing with disputes or complaints arising under, or in relation to, the code; (c) dealing with matters relating to a prospective agreement (including disputes or complaints relating to such an agreement) that would, if entered into, have the effect that one or more parties to the agreement is a participant in the industry to which the code relates; (d) conducting investigations under, or in relation to, the code; (e) providing exemptions from the code or specified provisions of the code; (f) reviewing, or reporting on, the operation of the code or activities under, or in relation to, the code; (g) any other matter relating to the operation, application or administration of the code. (1B) For the purposes of subsection (1A), the persons or bodies on whom an industry code may confer functions and powers are: (a) if the function or power is a function of providing, or a power to provide, exemptions from the code or specified provisions of the code—any of the following: (i) the Commission; (ii) the Australian Energy Regulator; (iii) a Minister (whether or not a Minister administering this provision); or (b) otherwise—any person or body whether or not a participant in the industry to which the code relates, including the following: (i) a person or body referred to in subparagraph (a)(i), (ii) or (iii); (ii) any person from time to time holding, occupying or performing the duties of a specified office or position. How functions and powers are to be exercised (1C) If an industry code prescribed by the regulations confers on a person or body a function or power in relation to the code, the code may provide that the function or power is to be exercised by legislative instrument or other kind of written instrument. (1D) However, if an industry code confers on a person or body a function of providing, or a power to provide, exemptions from the code or specified provisions of the code, then (despite anything to the contrary in the code): (a) the function or power must be exercised by written instrument (an exemption instrument ); and (b) if the code does not provide that an exemption instrument made under the code is a legislative instrument, then: (i) if each exemption provided by the instrument relates to a particular entity—the instrument is a notifiable instrument; or (ii) otherwise—the instrument is a legislative instrument. Note: If the code provides that an exemption instrument made under the code is a legislative instrument, then the instrument is a legislative instrument: see subsection 8(2) of the Legislation Act 2003 . Requirements to provide information (1E) An industry code prescribed by the regulations: (a) may require a person or body to provide another person or body with information or documents relevant to the operation, application or administration of the code (whether or not any of those persons or bodies are participants in the industry to which the code relates); and (b) may confer on a person or body (whether or not a participant in the industry to which the code relates) a function of imposing, or a power to impose, a requirement of the kind mentioned in paragraph (a). (1F) Paragraph (1E)(b) does not limit subsection (1A). Pecuniary penalties (2) If regulations prescribe an industry code (other than a code that relates to the industry of franchising or food and groceries), the industry code may prescribe a pecuniary penalty not exceeding 600 penalty units for a contravention of a civil penalty provision of the code. (2A) If regulations prescribe an industry code that relates to the industry of franchising or food and groceries, the industry code may do the following: (a) prescribe that the pecuniary penalty for a contravention of a civil penalty provision of the code by a body corporate is the greatest of the following: (i) $10,000,000; (ii) if the Court can determine the value of the benefit that the body corporate, and any body corporate related to the body corporate, has obtained directly or indirectly and that is reasonably attributable to the contravention—3 times the value of that benefit; (iii) if the Court cannot determine the value of that benefit—10% of the adjusted turnover of the body corporate during the period of 12 months ending at the end of the month in which the contravention occurred; (b) prescribe that the pecuniary penalty for a contravention of a civil penalty provision of the code by a person who is not a body corporate is $500,000; (c) if the code does not prescribe a pecuniary penalty mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b) for a contravention of a civil penalty provision of the code by a person—prescribe the following for the contravention: (i) in the case of an industry code that relates to the industry of franchising—a pecuniary penalty not exceeding 600 penalty units; (ii) in the case of an industry code that relates to the industry of food and groceries—a pecuniary penalty not exceeding 3,200 penalty units if the person is a body corporate and 640 penalty units if the person is not a body corporate. (2B) An expression used paragraph (2A)(a) has the same meaning as in subsection 76(1C). Incorporation of matters contained in other instruments (3) If regulations prescribe an industry code that applies to one or more entities that are authorised by or under a law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory to sell electricity, the regulations may make provision in relation to a matter by applying, adopting or incorporating, with or without modification, any matter contained in an instrument or other writing as in force or existing from time to time. (4) Subsection (3) applies despite subsection 14(2) of the Legislation Act 2003 ."

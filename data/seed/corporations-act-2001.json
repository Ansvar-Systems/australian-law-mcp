Note: The State referrals fully supplement the Commonwealth Parliament’s other powers by referring the matters to the Commonwealth Parliament to the extent to which they are not otherwise included in the legislative powers of the Commonwealth Parliament. (2) The operation of this Act in the Territories is based on: (a) the legislative powers that the Commonwealth Parliament has under section 122 of the Constitution to make laws for the government of those Territories; and (b) the legislative powers that the Commonwealth Parliament has under section 51 of the Constitution. Despite section 2H of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 , this Act as applying in those Territories is a law of the Commonwealth. (3) The operation of this Act outside Australia is based on: (a) the legislative power the Commonwealth Parliament has under paragraph 51(xxix) of the Constitution; and (b) the other legislative powers that the Commonwealth Parliament has under section 51 of the Constitution; and (c) the legislative powers that the Commonwealth Parliament has under section 122 of the Constitution to make laws for the government of the external Territories.

      "content": "Reference of matters by State Parliament to Commonwealth Parliament (1) A State is a referring State if the Parliament of the State has referred the matters covered by subsections (4) and (5) to the Parliament of the Commonwealth for the purposes of paragraph 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution: (a) if and to the extent that the matters are not otherwise included in the legislative powers of the Parliament of the Commonwealth (otherwise than by a reference under paragraph 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution); and (b) if and to the extent to which the matters are included in the legislative powers of the Parliament of the State. This subsection has effect subject to subsections (6) and (7). (2) A State is a referring State even if the State reference Act includes a provision to the effect that nothing in the State reference Act is intended to enable the making of laws pursuant to the amendment reference with the sole or main underlying purpose or object of regulating industrial relations matters even if, but for that provision in the State reference Act, the law would be a law with respect to a matter referred to the Parliament of the Commonwealth by the amendment reference. (3) A State is a referring State even if a law of the State provides that the reference to the Commonwealth Parliament of either or both of the matters covered by subsections (4) and (5) is to terminate in particular circumstances. Reference covering initial Corporations Act and ASIC Act (4) This subsection covers the matters to which the referred provisions relate to the extent of making laws with respect to those matters by including the referred provisions in the initial Corporations Act and the initial ASIC Act. Reference covering amendments of this Act and ASIC Act (5) This subsection covers the matters of the formation of corporations, corporate regulation and the regulation of financial products and services to the extent of the making of laws with respect to those matters by making express amendments of this Act or the ASIC Act. Effect of termination of reference (6) A State ceases to be a referring State if the State’s initial reference terminates. (7) A State ceases to be a referring State if: (a) the State’s amendment reference terminates; and (b) subsection (8) does not apply to the termination. (8) A State does not cease to be a referring State because of the termination of its amendment reference if: (a) the termination is effected by the Governor of that State fixing a day by proclamation as the day on which the reference terminates; and (b) the day fixed is no earlier than the first day after the end of the period of 6 months beginning on the day on which the proclamation is published; and (c) that State’s amendment reference, and the amendment reference of every other State, terminates on the same day. Definitions (9) In this section: amendment reference of a State means the reference by the Parliament of the State to the Parliament of the Commonwealth of the matters covered by subsection (5). express amendment of this Act or the ASIC Act means the direct amendment of the text of this Act or the ASIC Act (whether by the insertion, omission, repeal, substitution or relocation of words or matter) by Commonwealth Acts, but does not include the enactment by a Commonwealth Act of a provision that has, or will have, substantive effect otherwise than as part of the text of this Act or the ASIC Act. initial ASIC Act means the ASIC Act as originally enacted. initial Corporations Act means this Act as originally enacted. initial reference of a State means the reference by the Parliament of the State to the Parliament of the Commonwealth of the matters covered by subsection (4). referred provisions means: (a) the initial Corporations Act; and (b) the initial ASIC Act; to the extent to which they deal with matters that are included in the legislative powers of the Parliaments of the States. State reference Act for a State is the law under which the initial reference and the amendment reference are given."

Section does not deal with provisions capable of concurrent operation (2) This section does not apply to a provision of a law of a State or Territory that is capable of concurrent operation with the Corporations legislation. Note: This kind of provision is dealt with by section 5E. When this section applies to a provision of a State or Territory law (3) This section applies to the interaction between: (a) a provision of a law of a State or Territory (the State provision ); and (b) a provision of the Corporations legislation (the Commonwealth provision ); only if the State provision meets the conditions set out in the following table: Conditions to be met before section applies [operative] Item Kind of provision Conditions to be met a pre - commencement (commenced) provision (a) the State provision operated, immediately before this Act commenced, despite the provision of: that corresponds to the Commonwealth provision; and (b) the State provision is not declared to be one that this section does not apply to (either generally or specifically in relation to the Commonwealth provision) by: a pre - commencement (enacted) provision (a) the State provision would have operated, immediately before this Act commenced, despite the provision of: that corresponds to the Commonwealth provision if the State provision had commenced before the commencement of this Act; and (b) the State provision is not declared to be one that this section does not apply to (either generally or specifically in relation to the Commonwealth provision) by: a post - commencement provision the State provision is declared by a law of the State or Territory to be a Corporations legislation displacement provision for the purposes of this section (either generally or specifically in relation to the Commonwealth provision) a provision that is materially amended on or after this Act commenced if the amendment was enacted before this Act commenced (a) the State provision as amended would have operated, immediately before this Act commenced, despite the provision of: that corresponds to the Commonwealth provision if the amendment had commenced before the commencement of this Act; and (b) the State provision is not declared to be one that this section does not apply to (either generally or specifically in relation to the Commonwealth provision) by: a provision that is materially amended on or after this Act commenced if the amendment is enacted on or after this Act commenced the State provision as amended is declared by a law of the State or Territory to be a Corporations legislation displacement provision for the purposes of this section (either generally or specifically in relation to the Commonwealth provision) Note 1: Item 1—subsection (12) tells you when a provision is a pre - commencement (commenced) provision. Note 2: Item 1 paragraph (a)—For example, a State or Territory provision enacted after the commencement of the Corporations Law might not have operated despite the Corporations Law if it was not expressly provided that the provision was to operate despite a specified provision, or despite any provision, of the Corporations Law (see, for example, section 5 of the Corporations (New South Wales) Act 1990). Note 3: Item 2—subsection (13) tells you when a provision is a pre - commencement (enacted) provision. Note 4: Item 3—subsection (14) tells you when a provision is a post - commencement provision. Note 5: Subsections (15) to (17) tell you when a provision is materially amended after commencement. State and Territory laws specifically authorising or requiring act or thing to be done (4) A provision of the Corporations legislation does not: (a) prohibit the doing of an act; or (b) impose a liability (whether civil or criminal) for doing an act; if a provision of a law of a State or Territory specifically authorises or requires the doing of that act. Instructions given to directors under State and Territory laws (5) If a provision of a law of a State or Territory specifically: (a) authorises a person to give instructions to the directors or other officers of a company or body; or (b) requires the directors of a company or body to: (i) comply with instructions given by a person; or (ii) have regard to matters communicated to the company or body by a person; or (c) provides that a company or body is subject to the control or direction of a person; a provision of the Corporations legislation does not: (d) prevent the person from giving an instruction to the directors or exercising control or direction over the company or body; or (e) without limiting subsection (4): (i) prohibit a director from complying with the instruction or direction; or (ii) impose a liability (whether civil or criminal) on a director for complying with the instruction or direction. The person is not taken to be a director of a company or body for the purposes of the Corporations legislation merely because the directors of the company or body are accustomed to act in accordance with the person’s instructions. Use of names authorised by State and Territory laws (6) The provisions of Part 2B.6 and Part 5B.3 of this Act do not: (a) prohibit a company or other body from using a name if the use of the name is expressly provided for, or authorised by, a provision of a law of a State or Territory; or (b) require a company or other body to use a word as part of its name if the company or body is expressly authorised not to use that word by a provision of a law of a State or Territory. Meetings held in accordance with requirements of State and Territory laws (7) The provisions of Chapter 2G of this Act do not apply to the calling or conduct of a meeting of a company to the extent to which the meeting is called or conducted in accordance with a provision of a law of a State or Territory. Any resolutions passed at the meeting are as valid as if the meeting had been called and conducted in accordance with this Act. External administration under State and Territory laws (8) The provisions of Chapter 5 of this Act do not apply to a scheme of arrangement, receivership, winding up or other external administration of a company to the extent to which the scheme, receivership, winding up or administration is carried out in accordance with a provision of a law of a State or Territory. State and Territory laws dealing with company constitutions (9) If a provision of a law of a State or Territory provides that a provision is included, or taken to be included, in a company’s constitution, the provision is included in the company’s constitution even though the procedures and other requirements of this Act are not complied with in relation to the provision. (10) If a provision of a law of a State or Territory provides that additional requirements must be met for an alteration of a company’s constitution to take effect, the alteration does not take effect unless those requirements are met. Other cases (11) A provision of the Corporations legislation does not operate in a State or Territory to the extent necessary to ensure that no inconsistency arises between: (a) the provision of the Corporations legislation; and (b) a provision of a law of the State or Territory that would, but for this subsection, be inconsistent with the provision of the Corporations legislation. Note 1: A provision of the State or Territory law is not covered by this subsection if one of the earlier subsections in this section applies to the provision: if one of those subsections applies there would be no potential inconsistency to be dealt with by this subsection. Note 2: The operation of the provision of the State or Territory law will be supported by section 5E to the extent to which it can operate concurrently with the provision of the Corporations legislation.

      "content": "(1) The Dictionary in section 9 includes a definition for each term that is defined in this Act, except: (a) a term that is defined for the purposes of a single section or part of a single section; and (b) a term that is defined for the purposes of Chapter 10 (transitional provisions) or Schedule 4 (transfer of financial institutions and friendly societies); and (c) a term that is defined for the purposes of Schedule 2 (the Insolvency Practice Schedule). In some cases, the definition is a signpost to another provision or Act which defines the term. Note 1: An example for paragraph (a) is a definition that is expressed as being for the purposes of a section or subsection. Note 2: Schedule 2 also has its own Dictionary: see section 5 - 5 of Schedule 2. Subject to Schedule 2, the Dictionary in section 9 also has effect for the purposes of Schedule 2. Note 3: This Part, including the Dictionary in section 9, also has effect for the purposes of the ASIC Act: see subsection 5(2) of that Act. (2) Within a definition, the defined term is identified by bold italics . Note: This Act also uses bold italics to “tag” a concept with a label for use as a narrative device. (3) To the extent that a term used in a provision is not defined in this Act, it has its ordinary meaning. Example 1: The definition of complaint in section 9 defines the term only in Part 7.8A. The term has it its ordinary meaning in all other Parts of this Act. Example 2: The definition of participant in section 9 defines the term only in relation to a clearing and settlement facility and in relation to a financial market. The term has it its ordinary meaning when used in relation to all other persons and things."

Note 2: This Division provides that a person may sign a document in physical form or electronic form: see subsection 110A(1). Signing of documents by or on behalf of company (2) Without limiting subsection (1), this Division applies to a document (including a deed) to be signed by a person: (a) exercising the powers of a company under section 126 (making of contracts and execution of documents by an agent); or (b) under section 127 (execution of documents by a company). Other ways of signing documents not limited (4) This Division does not limit the ways in which a person may sign a document (including a deed).

Note: A document (including a deed) may be executed by or on behalf of a company without the use of paper, parchment or vellum: see subsections 126(6) and 127(3A). (2) A method of signing satisfies this subsection if: (a) the method identifies the person and indicates the person’s intention in respect of the information recorded in the document; and (b) the method was either: (i) as reliable as appropriate for the purpose for which the information was recorded, in light of all the circumstances, including any relevant agreement; or (ii) proven in fact to have fulfilled the functions described in paragraph (a), by itself or together with further evidence. What information the intention must cover (3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(a), the person is not required to indicate an intention in relation to: (a) any material identifying another person signing the document or indicating another person’s intention in respect of the information recorded; or (b) the signature of another person signing the document; or (c) if a common seal is fixed to the document—the seal; or (d) any immaterial information in a form of the document generated for the purposes of signing and which arises in the normal course of communication, storage or display. Note: This subsection allows minor differences that arise from the way a document is signed to be disregarded. For example, a person can sign to witness the fixing of a common seal to a document, and it is not necessary for the signed document to include the common seal (as long as a method is used to indicate that the person observed the fixing of the seal, as required by paragraph 127(2A)(c)). Avoidance of doubt (4) To avoid doubt, this section does not require: (a) a person to sign the same form of the document as another person; or (b) a person to sign the same page of the document as another person; or (c) a person to use the same method to sign the document as another person; or (d) all the information recorded in the document to be included in the form of the document signed by a person as mentioned in paragraph (1)(a) or (b). Note: For example, a company may execute a document by one director signing a physical form of the document by hand, and another director signing an electronic form of the document by electronic means. Persons signing in different capacities (5) For the purposes of this section, a person who is to sign a document in more than one capacity: (a) is treated as a different person in each such capacity they sign the document; and (b) may sign the document in some or all of those capacities by signing the document once, if the document: (i) requires or permits the person to do so; and (ii) states the capacities in which the person is signing the document. Example 1: If a signature block in a document requires or permits a person to sign once as the sole director and sole company secretary of a company, the person may sign the document as the sole director and sole company secretary by signing that signature block. Example 2: If a signature block in a document requires or permits a person to sign once on behalf of 2 companies as an agent for both those companies, the person may sign the document as an agent for both those companies by signing that signature block. Example 3: A person who is to sign a document in their capacity as the director of one company and their capacity as the company secretary of another company must sign the document twice if: (a) one signature block in the document requires or permits the person to sign as the director of the first company; and (b) another signature block in the document requires or permits the person to sign as the company secretary of the second company."

Note: In particular, the validity of the sending of the document as mentioned in paragraph (1)(b) is not affected. Regardless of any contravention of subsection (2), if the sender is required under another provision of this Act to send a document to which this Division applies, that requirement is met if the document is sent in accordance with section 110D and in accordance with any timing requirements under that other provision."

Note 2: Section 1223B applies instead of this section in relation to the constitution of a CCIV (see also subsection 1223D(6)). (2) The company may modify or repeal its constitution, or a provision of its constitution, by special resolution. Note: The company may need leave of the Court to modify or repeal its constitution if it was adopted as the result of a Court order (see subsection 233(3)). (3) The company’s constitution may provide that the special resolution does not have any effect unless a further requirement specified in the constitution relating to that modification or repeal has been complied with. (4) Unless the constitution provides otherwise, the company may modify or repeal a further requirement described in subsection (3) only if the further requirement is itself complied with. (5) A public company must lodge with ASIC a copy of a special resolution adopting, modifying or repealing its constitution within 14 days after it is passed. The company must also lodge with ASIC within that period: (a) if the company adopts a constitution—a copy of that constitution; or (b) if the company modifies its constitution—a copy of that modification. This also applies to a proprietary company that has applied under Part 2B.7 to change to a public company, while its application has not yet been determined. (6) An offence based on subsection (5) is an offence of strict liability. Note: For strict liability , see section 6.1 of the Criminal Code ."

Note: If a board limit resolution is not passed, the number of directors of a company that can be appointed (for example by a general meeting) depends on the maximum number of directors specified by the company’s constitution. This is so even if the directors purport to set a board limit despite the fact the board limit resolution was not passed. (3) If: (a) one or more directors are appointed by one or more resolutions passed at a particular general meeting of the company; and (b) because of the board limit, the general meeting was not given the opportunity to pass one or more resolutions appointing a number of directors such that the number of directors of the company would (if those resolutions had been passed) have exceeded the board limit; every appointment of director made by a resolution passed at the general meeting is invalid. Note: This subsection does not apply if a shortage of persons consenting to be appointed director was the reason the general meeting was not given the opportunity to pass one or more resolutions appointing a number of directors such that the number of directors of the company would (if those resolutions had been passed) have exceeded the board limit. (4) Subsections (2) and (3) have effect despite anything else in the company’s constitution or in this Act, except sections 128, 129 and 201M.

Company and candidates for directors may seek compensation (5) Subsection (6) applies if either of the following (the suffering party ) suffers loss or damage because of the setting of the board limit in contravention of subsection 201P(1): (a) the company; (b) a person for whom both the following conditions are met: (i) the person had given the company a written indication that he or she would be a candidate to be appointed director at a general meeting; (ii) because of the board limit, the general meeting was not given the opportunity to consider passing a resolution to appoint the person as director. (6) The suffering party may institute a proceeding in the Court for the contravention. Note: Section 1325 deals with the orders the Court may make to compensate the suffering party for the loss.

Note: This means the vote is not counted in working out a percentage of votes cast or whether the resolution is passed, and does not affect the validity of the resolution. (9) For the purposes of this section, a vote is cast on behalf of a person if, and only if, it is cast: (a) as proxy for the person; or (b) otherwise on behalf of the person; or (c) in respect of a share in respect of which the person has: (i) power to vote; or (ii) power to exercise, or control the exercise of, a right to vote. (10) Subject to Part 1.1A, subsections (4), (5), (6), (7), (8) and (9) have effect despite: (a) anything else in: (i) this Act; or (ii) any other law (including the general law) of a State or Territory; and (b) anything in the company’s constitution."

Note: Subsection 201A(2) requires the company to have at least 3 directors. (2) Enough directors to ensure that the company has 3 directors immediately after the spill meeting are taken to have been appointed, by resolution passed at the spill meeting, from the persons who: (a) gave the company signed consents to act as directors of the company in anticipation of being appointed by such a resolution; and (b) were not appointed as directors by such a resolution apart from this section. Note: The number of directors taken under subsection (2) to have been appointed is the difference between 3 and the number of directors holding office immediately after the spill meeting apart from this section. (3) The persons taken to have been appointed are those with the highest percentages of votes favouring their appointment cast at the spill meeting on the resolution for their appointment (even if less than half the votes cast on the resolution were in favour of their appointment). Example: Suppose that, under subsection (2), 2 directors are taken to have been appointed, and the percentages of votes favouring appointment were 50% for Jean, 40% for Karl and 30% for Lionel. Jean and Karl would both be taken to have been appointed directors, but Lionel would not. (4) For the purposes of this section, if 2 or more persons have the same percentage of votes favouring their appointment, the one of those persons chosen by the director or directors who hold office apart from this subsection is taken to have a higher percentage than the rest of those persons. Note: A director who holds office apart from subsection (4) could make a series of choices if 3 or more persons all have the same percentage of votes favouring their appointment and it is necessary to work out which 2 of those persons are taken to be appointed as directors. (5) If a person is taken to have been appointed because of a choice under subsection (4), the company must confirm the appointment by resolution at the company’s next AGM. If the appointment is not confirmed, the person ceases to be a director of the company at the end of the AGM.

Validity of sale (12) If a sale is not held in time because of error or inadvertence, a late sale is not invalid if it is held as soon as practicable after the discovery of the error or inadvertence. Failure to comply an offence (13) If there is failure to comply with subsection (2) or (3), the company is guilty of an offence.

A cancellation of a share for no consideration is a reduction of share capital, but paragraph (b) does not apply to this kind of reduction. Note 1: One of the ways in which a company might reduce its share capital is cancelling uncalled capital. Note 2: Sections 258A - 258F deal with some of the other situations in which reductions of share capital are authorised. Subsection 254K(2) authorises capital reductions involved in the redemption of redeemable preference shares and subsection 257A(2) authorises reductions involved in share buy - backs.

Note 4: For the criminal liability of a person dishonestly involved in a contravention of subsection 256D(1) based on this subsection, see subsection 256D(4). Section 79 defines involved .

(1A) To avoid doubt, a cancellation of a partly - paid share is taken to be for consideration. (2) The reduction is either an equal reduction or a selective reduction. The reduction is an equal reduction if: (a) it relates only to ordinary shares; and (b) it applies to each holder of ordinary shares in proportion to the number of ordinary shares they hold; and (c) the terms of the reduction are the same for each holder of ordinary shares. Otherwise, the reduction is a selective reduction . (3) In applying subsection (2), ignore differences in the terms of the reduction that are: (a) attributable to the fact that shares have different accrued dividend entitlements; or (b) attributable to the fact that shares have different amounts unpaid on them; or (c) introduced solely to ensure that each shareholder is left with a whole number of shares."

(3) In applying subsection (2), ignore: (a) differences in consideration attributable to the fact that the offers relate to shares having different accrued dividend entitlements; (b) differences in consideration attributable to the fact that the offers relate to shares on which different amounts remain unpaid; (c) differences in the offers introduced solely to ensure that each shareholder is left with a whole number of shares. 10/12 limit (4) The 10/12 limit for a company proposing to make a buy - back is 10% of the smallest number, at any time during the last 12 months, of votes attaching to voting shares of the company. Exceeding the 10/12 limit (5) A proposed buy - back would exceed the 10/12 limit if the number of votes attaching to: (a) all the voting shares in the company that have been bought back during the last 12 months; and (b) the voting shares that will be bought back if the proposed buy - back is made; would exceed the 10/12 limit. On - market buy - backs (6) A buy - back is an on - market buy - back if it results from an offer made by a listed corporation on a declared financial market in the ordinary course of trading on that market. (7) A buy - back by a company (whether listed or not) is also an on - market buy - back if it results from an offer made in the ordinary course of trading in a financial market outside Australia which ASIC declares in writing to be an approved overseas financial market for the purposes of this subsection. A buy - back by a listed company is an on - market buy - back under this subsection only if an offer to buy - back those shares is also made on a declared financial market at the same time. (8) A declaration under subsection (7) may be subject to conditions. Notice of the making of the declaration must be published in the Gazette ."

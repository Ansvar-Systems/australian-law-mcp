(2) The question whether the person was suffering from a mental impairment is one of fact. (3) A person is presumed not to have been suffering from such a mental impairment. The presumption is only displaced if it is proved on the balance of probabilities (by the prosecution or the defence) that the person was suffering from such a mental impairment. (4) The prosecution can only rely on this section if the court gives leave. (5) The tribunal of fact must return a special verdict that a person is not guilty of an offence because of mental impairment if and only if it is satisfied that the person is not criminally responsible for the offence only because of a mental impairment. (6) A person cannot rely on a mental impairment to deny voluntariness or the existence of a fault element but may rely on this section to deny criminal responsibility. (7) If the tribunal of fact is satisfied that a person carried out conduct as a result of a delusion caused by a mental impairment, the delusion cannot otherwise be relied on as a defence. (8) In this Code: mental impairment includes senility, intellectual disability, mental illness, brain damage and severe personality disorder. (9) The reference in subsection (8) to mental illness is a reference to an underlying pathological infirmity of the mind, whether of long or short duration and whether permanent or temporary, but does not include a condition that results from the reaction of a healthy mind to extraordinary external stimuli. However, such a condition may be evidence of a mental illness if it involves some abnormality and is prone to recur."

(3) Paragraph (2)(b) does not apply if the body corporate proves that it exercised due diligence to prevent the conduct, or the authorisation or permission. (4) Factors relevant to the application of paragraph (2)(c) or (d) include: (a) whether authority to commit an offence of the same or a similar character had been given by a high managerial agent of the body corporate; and (b) whether the employee, agent or officer of the body corporate who committed the offence believed on reasonable grounds, or entertained a reasonable expectation, that a high managerial agent of the body corporate would have authorised or permitted the commission of the offence. (5) If recklessness is not a fault element in relation to a physical element of an offence, subsection (2) does not enable the fault element to be proved by proving that the board of directors, or a high managerial agent, of the body corporate recklessly engaged in the conduct or recklessly authorised or permitted the commission of the offence. (6) In this section: board of directors means the body (by whatever name called) exercising the executive authority of the body corporate. corporate culture means an attitude, policy, rule, course of conduct or practice existing within the body corporate generally or in the part of the body corporate in which the relevant activities takes place. high managerial agent means an employee, agent or officer of the body corporate with duties of such responsibility that his or her conduct may fairly be assumed to represent the body corporate’s policy."

(3) Subsections (4) and (5) also apply to conduct if the conduct is a preliminary act that occurs in a State that is not a referring State and: (a) the terrorist act to which the preliminary act relates consists of an action and the action occurs, or would occur, in a State that is not a referring State; or (b) the terrorist act to which the preliminary act relates consists of a threat of action and the threat is made, or would be made, in a State that is not a referring State. (4) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Part, this Part applies to the conduct only to the extent to which the Parliament has power to legislate in relation to: (a) if the conduct is itself a terrorist act—the action or threat of action that constitutes the terrorist act; or (b) if the conduct is a preliminary act—the action or threat of action that constitutes the terrorist act to which the preliminary act relates. (5) Without limiting the generality of subsection (4), this Part applies to the action or threat of action if: (a) the action affects, or if carried out would affect, the interests of: (i) the Commonwealth; or (ii) an authority of the Commonwealth; or (iii) a constitutional corporation; or (b) the threat is made to: (i) the Commonwealth; or (ii) an authority of the Commonwealth; or (iii) a constitutional corporation; or (c) the action is carried out by, or the threat is made by, a constitutional corporation; or (d) the action takes place, or if carried out would take place, in a Commonwealth place; or (e) the threat is made in a Commonwealth place; or (f) the action involves, or if carried out would involve, the use of a postal service or other like service; or (g) the threat is made using a postal or other like service; or (h) the action involves, or if carried out would involve, the use of an electronic communication; or (i) the threat is made using an electronic communication; or (j) the action disrupts, or if carried out would disrupt, trade or commerce: (i) between Australia and places outside Australia; or (ii) among the States; or (iii) within a Territory, between a State and a Territory or between 2 Territories; or (k) the action disrupts, or if carried out would disrupt: (i) banking (other than State banking not extending beyond the limits of the State concerned); or (ii) insurance (other than State insurance not extending beyond the limits of the State concerned); or (l) the action is, or if carried out would be, an action in relation to which the Commonwealth is obliged to create an offence under international law; or (m) the threat is one in relation to which the Commonwealth is obliged to create an offence under international law.

Definition of advocates (1A) In this Division, an organisation advocates the doing of a terrorist act if: (a) the organisation directly or indirectly counsels, promotes, encourages or urges the doing of a terrorist act; or (b) the organisation directly or indirectly provides instruction on the doing of a terrorist act; or (c) the organisation directly praises the doing of a terrorist act in circumstances where there is a substantial risk that such praise might have the effect of leading a person (regardless of his or her age or any mental impairment that the person might suffer) to engage in a terrorist act. Terrorist organisation regulations (2) Before the Governor - General makes a regulation specifying an organisation for the purposes of paragraph (b) of the definition of terrorist organisation in this section, the AFP Minister must be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the organisation: (a) is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act; or (b) advocates the doing of a terrorist act. (2A) Before the Governor - General makes a regulation specifying an organisation for the purposes of paragraph (b) of the definition of terrorist organisation in this section, the AFP Minister must arrange for the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives to be briefed in relation to the proposed regulation.

(4A) The declaration must specify the day on which the Minister ceased to be so satisfied. (4B) The regulations, to the extent to which they specify the organisation, are taken to cease to have effect on the day specified in the declaration under subsection (4A), even if that day occurred before the day on which the declaration is made. (5) To avoid doubt, subsections (4) to (4B) do not prevent the organisation from being subsequently specified by regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (b) of the definition of terrorist organisation in this section if the AFP Minister becomes satisfied as mentioned in subsection (2). (16) Subsection (17) applies if: (a) an organisation (the listed organisation ) is specified in regulations made for the purposes of paragraph (b) of the definition of terrorist organisation in this section; and (b) an individual or an organisation (which may be the listed organisation) makes an application (the de - listing application ) to the AFP Minister for a declaration under subsection (4) in relation to the listed organisation; and (c) the de - listing application is made on the grounds that there is no basis for the AFP Minister to be satisfied that the listed organisation: (i) is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act; or (ii) advocates the doing of a terrorist act; as the case requires; and (d) the AFP Minister did not receive an application from any individual or organisation under paragraph (b) of this subsection in relation to the listed organisation during the 12 months ending when the AFP Minister receives the de - listing application.

Note: If the AFP Minister ceases to be satisfied of either of these (as the case requires), the AFP Minister must make a declaration under subsection (4) in relation to the listed organisation. (18) Subsections (16) and (17) do not limit the matters that may be considered by the AFP Minister for the purposes of subsection (4). (20) In this section, a reference to the doing of a terrorist act includes: (a) a reference to the doing of a terrorist act, even if a terrorist act does not occur; and (b) a reference to the doing of a specific terrorist act; and (c) a reference to the doing of more than one terrorist act."

Note 1: An interim control order made in relation to a person must be served on the person at least 48 hours before the day specified as mentioned in paragraph (1)(e) (see section 104.12). Note 2: If the person is 14 to 17 years of age, then a confirmed control order must not end more than 3 months after the day on which the interim control order is made (see section 104.28). Attendance of person at court (1A) The day specified for the purposes of paragraph (1)(e) must be as soon as practicable, but at least 7 days, after the order is made. (1B) In specifying a day for the purposes of paragraph (1)(e), the issuing court must take into account: (a) that the persons mentioned in subsection 104.14(1) may need to prepare in order to adduce evidence or make submissions to the court in relation to the confirmation of the order; and (aa) if the person to whom the order relates is detained in custody—any other matter relating to the person’s detention that the court considers relevant; and (b) any other matter the court considers relevant. (1C) To avoid doubt, if the person is detained in custody, the person has a right to attend court on the day specified for the purposes of paragraph (1)(e). Rules relating to the period an interim control order is in force (1D) The interim control order does not begin to be in force when it is served personally on the person if, at that time: (a) the person is detained in custody in a prison; or (b) an extended supervision order or interim supervision order is in force in relation to the person. Note: An interim control order in relation to a person who is detained in non - prison custody begins to be in force when the order is served personally on the person (see paragraph (1)(d)). (1E) The interim control order referred to in subsection (1D) instead begins to be in force when all of the following conditions are met: (a) either of the following events occurs: (i) the person ceases to be detained in custody in a prison; (ii) the extended supervision order or interim supervision order ceases to be in force in relation to the person; (b) when the event occurs: (i) the interim control order has not been confirmed under section 104.14; and (ii) the person is in the community without an extended supervision order or interim supervision order being in force in relation to the person. Note: Persons detained in non - prison custody are taken to be in the community (see section 105A.18AA). (1F) To avoid doubt, the interim control order never comes into force if the condition in subparagraph (1E)(b)(ii) is not met. (2) Paragraph (1)(f) does not prevent the making of successive control orders in relation to the same person. (2AA) To avoid doubt, if a control order is in force in relation to a person, the control order does not cease to be in force merely because the person is detained in custody. National security information (2A) To avoid doubt, paragraph (1)(h) does not require any information to be included in the summary if disclosure of that information is likely to prejudice national security (within the meaning of the National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004 )."

(2) The Commissioner must cause the court to be given: (a) a copy of the additional conditions to be imposed on the person by the order; and (b) the following: (i) an explanation as to why each of those conditions should be imposed on the person; and (ii) if the Commissioner is aware of any facts relating to why any of those conditions should not be imposed on the person—a statement of those facts; and (c) the outcomes and particulars of all previous applications under this section for variations of the order; and (d) if the person is at least 18 years of age and the Commissioner has information about the person’s age—that information; and (e) if the person is under 18 years of age—information about the person’s age. Note 1: A control order cannot be made in relation to a person who is under 14 years of age (see section 104.28). Note 2: An offence might be committed if the application is false or misleading (see sections 137.1 and 137.2).

(3A) To avoid doubt, subsections (3) and (3AA) do not require any information to be given if disclosure of that information is likely: (a) to prejudice national security (within the meaning of the National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004 ); or (b) to be protected by public interest immunity; or (c) to put at risk ongoing operations by law enforcement agencies or intelligence agencies; or (d) to put at risk the safety of the community, law enforcement officers or intelligence officers. The fact that information of a kind mentioned in this subsection is not required to be disclosed does not imply that such information is required to be disclosed in other provisions of this Part that relate to the disclosure of information. (4) The following persons may adduce additional evidence (including by calling witnesses or producing material), or make additional submissions, to the court in relation to the application to vary the order: (a) the Commissioner; (b) one or more other AFP members; (c) the person in relation to whom the order is made; (d) one or more representatives of the person; (e) if paragraph (3)(b) applies—the Queensland public interest monitor. (5) Subsection (4) does not otherwise limit the power of the court to control proceedings in relation to an application to vary a confirmed control order.

(3) A continued preventative detention order under this section is an order that the person specified in the order may be detained during a further period that: (a) starts at the end of the period during which the person may be detained under the initial preventative detention order; and (b) ends a specified period of time after the person is first taken into custody under the initial preventative detention order. (4) The order must be in writing. (5) The period of time specified under paragraph (3)(b) must not exceed 48 hours. (6) A continued preventative detention order under this section must set out: (a) any of the following: (i) the true name of the person in relation to whom the order is made; (ii) if, after reasonable inquiries have been made, the person’s true name is not known but an alias is known for the person—the alias of the person in relation to whom the order is made; (iii) if, after reasonable inquiries have been made, the person’s true name is not known and no alias is known for the person—a description sufficient to identify the person in relation to whom the order is made; and (b) the further period during which the person may be detained under the order; and (c) the date on which, and the time at which, the order is made; and (d) a summary of the grounds on which the order is made.

Note: A person may be released, for example, so that the person may be arrested and otherwise dealt with under the provisions of Division 4 of Part IAA, and Part IC, of the Crimes Act 1914 . (2) If the police officer detaining the person under the order is not an AFP member: (a) the police officer must not release the person from detention without the approval of a senior AFP member; and (b) the senior AFP member must approve the person’s release if the person is being released so that the person may be dealt with in accordance with a warrant under Division 3 of Part III of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 . (3) The police officer who releases the person from detention under the preventative detention order must give the person a written statement that the person is being released from that detention. The statement must be signed by the police officer. (4) Subsection (3) does not apply if the police officer releases the person from detention so that the person may be dealt with: (a) in accordance with a warrant under Division 3 of Part III of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 ; or (b) under the provisions of Division 4 of Part IAA, and Part IC, of the Crimes Act 1914 . (5) To avoid doubt, a person may be taken to have been released from detention under a preventative detention order even if: (a) the person is informed that he or she is being released from detention under the order; and (b) the person is taken into custody, and detained in custody, on some other basis immediately after the person is informed that he or she is being released from detention under the order. (6) To avoid doubt, a person is taken not to be detained under a preventative detention order during a period during which the person is released from detention under the order. Note: During this period, the provisions of this Division that apply to a person who is being detained under a preventative detention order (for example, section 105.34 which deals with the people the person may contact) do not apply to the person. (7) To avoid doubt: (a) the release of the person under subsection (1) from detention under the preventative detention order does not extend the period for which the preventative detention order remains in force; and (b) a person released under subsection (1) from detention under a preventative detention order may again be taken into custody and detained under the order at any time while the order remains in force in relation to the person. Note: Paragraph (a)—this means that the time for which the person may be detained under the order continues to run while the person is released."

(2) For the purposes of this Code, an offence against subsection (1) is to be known as the offence of receiving. (2A) In a prosecution for an offence against subsection (1), it is not necessary to prove that the defendant knew or believed that the property belonged to a Commonwealth entity. Stolen property (3) For the purposes of this section, property is stolen property if, and only if: (a) it is original stolen property (as defined by subsection (5)); or (aa) it is previously received property (as defined by subsection (5A)); or (b) it is tainted property (as defined by subsection (7)). This subsection has effect subject to subsections (4) and (6). (4) For the purposes of this section, stolen property does not include land obtained in the course of an offence against section 134.1. Original stolen property (5) For the purposes of this section, original stolen property is: (a) property, or a part of property, that: (i) was appropriated in the course of theft (whether or not the property, or the part of the property, is in the state it was in when it was so appropriated); and (ii) is in the possession or custody of the person who so appropriated the property; or (b) property, or a part of property, that: (i) was obtained in the course of an offence against section 134.1 (whether or not the property, or the part of the property, is in the state it was in when it was so obtained); and (ii) is in the possession or custody of the person who so obtained the property or the person for whom the property was so obtained. Previously received property (5A) For the purposes of this section, previously received property is property that: (a) was received in the course of an offence against subsection (1); and (b) is in the possession or custody of the person who received the property in the course of that offence. (6) For the purposes of this section, property ceases to be original stolen property or previously received property: (a) after the property is restored: (i) to the person from whom it was appropriated or obtained; or (ii) to other lawful possession or custody; or (b) after: (i) the person from whom the property was appropriated or obtained ceases to have any right to restitution in respect of the property; or (ii) a person claiming through the person from whom the property was appropriated or obtained ceases to have any right to restitution in respect of the property. Tainted property (7) For the purposes of this section, tainted property is property that: (a) is (in whole or in part) the proceeds of sale of, or property exchanged for: (i) original stolen property; or (ii) previously received property; and (b) if subparagraph (a)(i) applies—is in the possession or custody of: (i) if the original stolen property was appropriated in the course of theft—the person who so appropriated the original stolen property; or (ii) if the original stolen property was obtained in the course of an offence against section 134.1—the person who so obtained the property or the person for whom the property was so obtained; and (c) if subparagraph (a)(ii) applies—is in the possession or custody of the person who received the previously received property in the course of an offence against subsection (1). Money transfers (8) For the purposes of this section, if, as a result of the application of subsection 134.1(9) or (10), an amount credited to an account held by a person is property obtained in the course of an offence against section 134.1: (a) while the whole or any part of the amount remains credited to the account, the property is taken to be in the possession of the person; and (b) if the person fails to take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to secure that the credit is cancelled—the person is taken to have received the property; and (c) subsection (6) of this section does not apply to the property. Note: Subsections 134.1(9) and (10) deal with money transfers. Alternative verdicts (9) If, in a prosecution for an offence of theft or an offence against section 134.1, the trier of fact is not satisfied that the defendant is guilty of the offence, but is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of an offence of receiving, the trier of fact may find the defendant not guilty of the offence of theft or the section 134.1 offence but guilty of the offence of receiving, so long as the defendant has been accorded procedural fairness in relation to that finding of guilt. (10) If, in a prosecution for an offence of receiving, the trier of fact is not satisfied that the defendant is guilty of the offence, but is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of an offence of theft or an offence against section 134.1, the trier of fact may find the defendant not guilty of the offence of receiving but guilty of the offence of theft or the section 134.1 offence, so long as the defendant has been accorded procedural fairness in relation to that finding of guilt. Receiving property stolen before commencement (11) For the purposes of this section: (a) it is to be assumed that sections 131.1 and 134.1 had been in force at all times before the commencement of this section; and (b) property that was appropriated or obtained at a time before the commencement of this section does not become original stolen property unless the property was appropriated or obtained in circumstances that (apart from paragraph (a)) amounted to an offence against a law of the Commonwealth in force at that time. Obtaining (12) The definition of obtaining in section 130.1 does not apply to this section. Note: See subsection 134.1(3). Definition (13) In this section: account has the same meaning as in section 133.1."

(12) For the purposes of this section (and for the purposes of the application of section 132.1 to this section), a person is taken to cause an amount to be transferred from an account if the person induces another person to transfer the amount from the account (whether or not the other person is the holder of the account). General deficiency (13) A person may be convicted of an offence against this section involving all or any part of a general deficiency in money even though the deficiency is made up of any number of particular sums of money that were obtained over a period of time. (14) A person may be convicted of an offence against this section involving all or any part of a general deficiency in property other than money even though the deficiency is made up of any number of particular items of property that were obtained over a period of time. Alternative verdicts (15) If, in a prosecution for an offence of theft, the trier of fact is not satisfied that the defendant is guilty of the offence, but is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of an offence against this section, the trier of fact may find the defendant not guilty of the offence of theft but guilty of the offence against this section, so long as the defendant has been accorded procedural fairness in relation to that finding of guilt.

Note 1: For prescription by class, see subsection 13(3) of the Legislation Act 2003 . Note 2: Data storage systems that store or process business critical data are part of the critical infrastructure asset: see subsection (7). (2) However, the rules may prescribe that a specified: (a) a critical telecommunications asset; or (b) a critical broadcasting asset; or (c) a critical domain name system; or (d) a critical data storage or processing asset; or (e) a critical banking asset; or (f) a critical superannuation asset; or (g) a critical insurance asset; or (h) a critical financial market infrastructure asset; or (i) a critical water asset; or (j) a critical electricity asset; or (k) a critical gas asset; or (l) a critical energy market operator asset; or (m) a critical liquid fuel asset; or (n) a critical hospital; or (o) a critical education asset; or (p) a critical food and grocery asset; or (q) a critical port; or (r) a critical freight infrastructure asset; or (s) a critical freight services asset; or (t) a critical public transport asset; or (u) a critical aviation asset; or (v) a critical defence industry asset; is not a critical infrastructure asset. Note: For prescription by class, see subsection 13(3) of the Legislation Act 2003 . (2A) If an asset is owned by: (a) the Commonwealth; or (b) a body corporate established by a law of the Commonwealth (other than a government business enterprise); the asset is not a critical infrastructure asset unless: (c) the asset is declared under section 51 to be a critical infrastructure asset; or (d) the asset is prescribed by the rules for the purposes of paragraph (1)(f). (2B) Subject to subsections (2C) and (2D), an asset is not a critical infrastructure asset if, or to the extent to which, the asset is located outside Australia. (2C) Subsection (2B) does not apply for the purposes of working out whether a satellite - based facility is a critical telecommunications asset if the satellite - based facility is in a satellite to which either or both of the following apply: (a) the satellite is included in the Register of Space Objects kept under section 76 of the Space (Launches and Returns) Act 2018 ; (b) Australia is the appropriate State Party for the purposes of undertaking the authorisation and continuing supervision required in respect of the satellite under Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty. Note: For the definitions of Outer Space Treaty and satellite - based facility , see section 5. (2D) Subsection (2B) does not apply for the purposes of working out whether a submarine cable is a critical telecommunications asset if the submarine cable is installed in Australian waters. Note: For the definitions of submarine cable and Australian waters , see section 5. Prescribing an asset as a critical infrastructure asset (3) The Minister must not prescribe an asset for the purposes of paragraph (1)(f) unless the Minister is satisfied that: (a) the asset is critical to: (i) the social or economic stability of Australia or its people; or (ii) the defence of Australia; or (iii) national security; and (b) the asset relates to a critical infrastructure sector. Consultation with State and Territory Ministers (4) The Minister (the Commonwealth Minister ) also must not prescribe the asset unless the Commonwealth Minister has: (a) consulted the following persons (the consulted Minister ): (i) the First Minister of the State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory in which the critical infrastructure asset is wholly or partly located; (ii) each Minister of a State, the Australian Capital Territory, or the Northern Territory, who has responsibility for the regulation or oversight of the relevant critical infrastructure sector in that State or Territory; and (b) given each consulted Minister written notice of the proposal to prescribe the asset; and (c) had regard to any representations given by a consulted Minister under subsection (5) within the period specified for that purpose. (5) The notice must invite each consulted Minister to make written representations to the Commonwealth Minister in relation to the proposal to prescribe the asset within the period specified in the notice, which must be: (a) at least 28 days after the notice is given; or (b) a shorter period if the Commonwealth Minister considers the shorter period is necessary because of urgent circumstances. (6) Subsection (4) does not limit the persons with whom the Commonwealth Minister may consult. Data storage systems (7) If, under this section, an asset is a critical infrastructure asset, then a data storage system in respect of which all of the following requirements are satisfied is taken to be part of the critical infrastructure asset: (a) the responsible entity for the critical infrastructure asset owns or operates the data storage system; (b) the data storage system is used, or is to be used, in connection with the critical infrastructure asset; (c) business critical data is stored, or is processed in or by, the data storage system (whether or not other information is also stored, or is processed in or by, the data storage system); (d) for a hazard where there is a material risk that the occurrence of the hazard could have an impact on the data storage system, there is also a material risk that the occurrence of the hazard could have a relevant impact on the critical infrastructure asset. Note: The effect of this subsection is, for example, that: (a) obligations under Part 2 in relation to a critical infrastructure asset will also need to take into account the data storage system; and (b) a critical infrastructure risk management program under Part 2A in relation to a critical infrastructure asset will also need to cover the data storage system; and (c) notification obligations under Part 2B of cyber security incidents relating to any relevant impact on a critical infrastructure asset will also need to take into account any relevant impact on the data storage system."

(1A) This section also applies if the Minister is satisfied that: (a) an incident: (i) has occurred; or (ii) is occurring; or (iii) is imminent; and (b) the incident has had, is having, or is likely to have, one or more relevant impacts on one or more critical infrastructure assets (each of which is a primary asset ); and (c) the incident relates to an emergency specified in a national emergency declaration (within the meaning of the National Emergency Declaration Act 2020 ) that is in force; and (d) no existing regulatory system of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory could be used to provide a practical and effective response to the incident. Authorisation (2) The Minister may, on application by the Secretary, do any or all of the following things: (a) authorise the Secretary to give directions under section 35AK, relating to the incident and one or more primary assets, to one or more relevant entities; (b) authorise the Secretary to give directions under section 35AK, relating to the incident and one or more specified critical infrastructure sector assets, to one or more relevant entities; (c) authorise the Secretary to give to one or more specified entities a specified direction under section 35AQ that relates to the incident and one or more specified primary assets; (d) authorise the Secretary to give to one or more specified entities a specified direction under section 35AQ that relates to the incident and one or more specified critical infrastructure sector assets; (e) authorise the Secretary to give one or more specified requests under section 35AX that relate to the incident and one or more specified primary assets; (f) authorise the Secretary to give one or more specified requests under section 35AX that relate to the incident and one or more specified critical infrastructure sector assets. Note 1: Section 35AK deals with information gathering directions. Note 2: Section 35AQ deals with action directions. Note 3: Section 35AX deals with intervention requests. The Minister must not give an authorisation under paragraph (2)(e) or (f) unless the Minister is satisfied that the incident is a cyber security incident: see subsection (10). (3) An authorisation under subsection (2) is to be known as a Ministerial authorisation . (4) Subsection 33(3AB) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 does not apply to subsection (2) of this section. Note: Subsection 33(3AB) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 deals with specification by class. Information gathering directions (5) A Ministerial authorisation under paragraph (2)(a) or (b): (a) is generally applicable to the incident and the asset or assets concerned; and (b) is to be made without reference to any specific directions. (6) The Minister must not give a Ministerial authorisation under paragraph (2)(a) or (b) unless the Minister is satisfied that the directions that could be authorised by the Ministerial authorisation are likely to facilitate a practical and effective response to the incident.

Note: Section 12P provides examples of responding to an incident (including a cyber security incident). (8) In determining whether the specified direction is a proportionate response to the incident, the Minister must have regard to: (a) the impact of the specified direction on: (i) the activities carried on by the specified entity; and (ii) the functioning of the asset or assets concerned; and (b) the consequences of compliance with the specified direction; and (c) such other matters (if any) as the Minister considers relevant. (9) The Minister must not give a Ministerial authorisation under paragraph (2)(c) or (d) in relation to a specified entity if the specified direction: (a) requires the specified entity to permit the authorised agency to do an act or thing that could be the subject of a request under section 35AX; or (b) requires the specified entity to take offensive cyber action against a person who is directly or indirectly responsible for the incident. (9A) Without limiting paragraph (2)(c) or (d), a direction referred to in that paragraph may require a specified entity to disclose specified personal information (within the meaning of the Privacy Act 1988 ) held by the entity to another specified entity for a specified purpose. (9B) However, the Minister must not give a Ministerial authorisation under paragraph (2)(c) or (d), to the extent that it authorises the giving of a direction covered by subsection (9A), unless the Minister has obtained the agreement of the Minister administering the Privacy Act 1988 . Intervention requests (10) The Minister must not give a Ministerial authorisation under paragraph (2)(e) or (f) that relates to the incident and an asset unless the Minister is satisfied that: (aa) the incident is a cyber security incident; and (a) giving a Ministerial authorisation under paragraph (2)(c) or (d) would not amount to a practical and effective response to the incident; and (b) if there is only one relevant entity for the asset—the relevant entity is unwilling or unable to take all reasonable steps to respond to the incident; and (c) if there are 2 or more relevant entities for the asset—those entities, when considered together, are unwilling or unable to take all reasonable steps to respond to the incident; and (d) the specified request is reasonably necessary for the purposes of responding to the incident; and (e) the specified request is a proportionate response to the incident; and (f) compliance with the specified request is technically feasible; and (g) each of the acts or things specified in the specified request is an act or thing of a kind covered by section 35AC. Note: Section 12P provides examples of responding to a cyber security incident. (11) In determining whether the specified request is a proportionate response to the incident, the Minister must have regard to: (a) the impact of compliance with the specified request on the functioning of the asset; and (b) the consequences of acts or things that would be done in compliance with the specified request; and (c) such other matters (if any) as the Minister considers relevant. (12) The Minister must not give a Ministerial authorisation under paragraph (2)(e) or (f) if compliance with the specified request would involve the authorised agency taking offensive cyber action against a person who is directly or indirectly responsible for the incident. (13) The Minister must not give a Ministerial authorisation under paragraph (2)(e) or (f) unless the Minister has obtained the agreement of: (a) the Prime Minister; and (b) the Defence Minister.
